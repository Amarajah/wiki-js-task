# wiki-js-task

The code in this repo is a script showing how JavaScript can be used to format and display JSON data dynamically within a webpage.<br>
Since the resulting data is delivered in a clear, human-readable format, users can easily interpret the information without needing to interact with raw JSON structures.<br>

Kindly note that running this exact script in browser is going to display not only the results you seek, but also your JS source code too. I left it as it is as I am working with a test template and I don't want to change the original source code too much<br>
To avoid this issue, please remove or comment out the troublesome lines of code(I indicated which ones in the HTML code).<br>
Once this is done, your code will run as expected but will only display the results section.
